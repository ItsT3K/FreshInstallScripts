# FreshInstallScripts
FreshInstallScripts is a collection of Installation Scripts I write for various Linux distributions. 
I make these scripts so when I do a new Linux installation I can easilly just get everything done in a quick amount of time.

These scripts were created to suit my needs but they can be modified to suit your or other peoples needs.

One prerequisite for these is simply `git` and `dialog`
